# ScoliosisX
## About
The project consists of a computerized system of support for medical decisions based on the use of Machine Learning to identify the type of deformation of the spine and quantify its degree of curvature in adolescent patients.
## Specific Objectives
<ul>
<li>Build a “dataset” of the images of radiographic plates with different scoliosis exposures to converge with new cases.</li>
<li>Preprocess the dataset for cleaning and filtering noise / impurity.</li>
<li>Normalize the dataset for further testing.</li>
<li>Extract through algorithmic techniques the sample and test records to train the decision support system.</li>
<li>Determine the appropriate artificial neural network method to find key points in the curvature of the spine.</li>
<li>Calculate the degree of curvature of the deformation of the spine from a two-dimensional mathematical curve.</li>
</ul>

## Techniques
<ul>
<li> Convolutional Neural Networks </li>
<li> Digital Process Processing </li>
<li> Contour Detection </li>
<li> K-means </li>
</ul>
